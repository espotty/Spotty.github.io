Description: Welcome to Spotty – the only repo that asks “Wanna Hack?” before it hacks you back.
Inside this tiny package lurks:
Dark-matter stars that follow your cursor like nosy neighbors.
Golden halos around icons—touch them and your device gains +10 Cydia points.
A Telegram bot that answers at 3 AM with “👀” when you request TikTok++.
A minified source so obfuscated even the NSA needs a coffee break.
Install at your own risk; we’re not liable if your SpringBoard starts speaking in binary.
